9:10am &#8211; I&#8217;m not a morning coffee guy but this morning required some chemical assistance to be at the conference on time.

9:40 &#8211; Jonathan Lam is talking about Microsoft&#8217;s version of Ruby, IronRuby. He showed an XAML XML file used to describe the UI in Silverlight. After 10 years in J2EE, I can honestly say that if you are using a tool to generate an XML file, you haven&#8217;t done enough work to make it easy to write by hand. Developers hate using proprietary tools.

11:45 &#8211; Evan Phoenix gave a great talk on Rubinius. His thesis? MRI is 125,000 lines of C. IronRuby is 45,000 lines of C#. JRuby is 110,000 lines of Java. In other words, to contribute to the various Ruby VMs, you need to be an expert in another language. This should be minimized; Rubinius is 25,000 lines of C and 13,000 lines of Ruby. Why not implement as much of the Ruby VM in Ruby so that Ruby developers, who are the people that most care, can contribute? A very persuasive argument.

1:45 &#8211; Ed Borasky talked about finding bottlenecks in Ruby 1.8 during his work on the COUGAR Project. He did a fine job explaining profiling and how he found a potential bottleneck. *But he didn&#8217;t fix it and determine how much the fix helped!?* What&#8217;s the point of writing a murder novel if in the end the detective announces &#8220;And the murderer is&#8230;&#8221; and dies? A very disappointing denouement.

3:05 &#8211; Bruce and Rich presented the &#8220;dense&#8221; Ruby client that InfoEther is building while working for us at FiveRuns. Nice job, guys. Aside from a sound system with a penchant for feedback, the presentation went well.

6:50 &#8211; All work and no sangria make Jack a dull boy.

7:00 &#8211; Live from Charlotte, it&#8217;s Matz!
