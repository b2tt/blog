Since I started this blog a few months ago, I&#8217;ve been cringing inside every time I see it and I&#8217;ll tell you why: I dislike default configurations. Invariably I want to tweak, tune or, if you&#8217;ll excuse the hip lingo, pimp everything I touch, especially if it involves software. This includes the theme for my blog, which until now was the default WordPress theme. Hasta la vista, Kubrick â€” you&#8217;ve been dumped for Cutline.

I&#8217;ll need to tweak the Google ads and analytics and spice up things here and there but hopefully you&#8217;ll feel more at home now, gentle reader.
