Good News Everybody!  I&#8217;ll be speaking at RubyConf 2008 in Orlando, FL in November on &#8220;Patterns in Distributed Computing&#8221;.  I&#8217;m going to discuss the various algorithms we&#8217;ve used to provide fault tolerance, reliablility and performance from server-side processing daemons.

In other news, this week marks my first anniversery in the professional Ruby world.  I&#8217;m pretty happy with what I&#8217;ve achieved so far and I hope the next year is just as fun and challenging.
