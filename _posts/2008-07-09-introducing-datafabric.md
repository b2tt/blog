I just published a new Ruby Gem which encapsulates the database sharding library we&#8217;ve been using in production with our [FiveRuns Manage][1] service.  I&#8217;m pretty proud of this release &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t easy code to write or test and I learned a LOT about ActiveRecord while writing it.  If you need sharding and you need to use ActiveRecord, give DataFabric a try.
