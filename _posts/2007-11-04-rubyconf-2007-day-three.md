Ugh, partied very hardy last night. Today is not good. Congrats, Ted. ;-)

I&#8217;m quite impressed with the Ruby community &#8211; most everyone is modest and fun to hang around with. We&#8217;re off to the Solr talk now.

Apologies to Damon, how could I forget Laurent&#8217;s amazing OSX talk? Apple has really done a standup job on Leopard. From a broken install in Tiger to a very well integrated install in Leopard, it&#8217;s clear that Apple is in for the long haul wrt Ruby. It should be noted that Apple has done the same for Python so they aren&#8217;t necessarily picking one particular scripting language to support.

He demoed some impressive capabilities: real-time 3D rendering using a bridge to the QuartzComposer APIs, speech synthesis, drag-n-drop Ruby programming using Xcode, &#8220;injecting&#8221; Ruby into a running process and controlling the windows. Really, really impressive stuff.

90% of the laptops were MacBooks. I&#8217;m sure the other 10% were corporate machines. As if it wasn&#8217;t apparently already, Apple is smart in playing nice with the Ruby community.

Well, we&#8217;re all done. (Hopefully) see you next year!
