Hello from Charlotte! I&#8217;ll be updating this post all day with random thoughts.

9:22am &#8211; If energy could be generated from t-shirts with nerdy quotes, this place could power the sun.

10:45 &#8211; Interesting talk from Jim Weirich on &#8220;how to parse without parsing&#8221;. Great mind twist on how to use Ruby&#8217;s dynamic nature to solve problems in a different manner than you might with Java/C++.

12:37 &#8211; Don&#8217;t look but there&#8217;s a fat nerd playing a lute at 3 o&#8217;clock.

1:30 &#8211; Next up: a talk on the [Camping micro-framework][1]. Your webapp built in 30 minutes or less or your money back. Speaker&#8217;s point: micro-frameworks are creative alternatives to the &#8220;big guys&#8221; like Rails and provide genetic diversity to the Ruby ecosystem.

2:23 &#8211; AP4R &#8211; a bit dry. The speaker does not speak English (well); it&#8217;s a straightforward description of a messaging system built in Ruby which is intended to replace their home-grown Java component.

3:38 &#8211; Nifty. [Treetop][2] is a next generation parsing framework. Looks similar to the JavaCC-based EDI parser I wrote years ago but supposedly has some tricky new algorithms that give it a tangy goodness, read the link for eyeball-bleeding parser-speak.

6:50 &#8211; Buzzed on local microbrewery sampler? Check. Jittery on giant Starbucks mocha? Check. We are locked and loaded for the Friday night keynote. Bring it on, Matz!

10:43 &#8211; Played my first and second game of Werewolf. My permanent smirk proves to be a huge disadvantage as Chad Fowler decides I&#8217;m untrustworthy and kills me instead of the actual werewolf. Alas.
