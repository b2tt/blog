I&#8217;ve been customizing the WordPress theme for this blog a little bit recently and been following Edward Tufte&#8217;s rules in [Visual Display of Quantitative Information][1] (which is a **highly** recommended read for any technologist). The rule which struck me most directly was *Minimize non-data ink*. In other words, let the content stand for itself and minimize any distraction to the user when looking at the content.

Take a look at the [original design for the Cutline theme][2] and compare it to this site. I wanted to add a little flair with my picture and the pictures of the conferences I&#8217;ve attended but aside from those I&#8217;ve tried to remove anything which seems to distract. What do you think?
