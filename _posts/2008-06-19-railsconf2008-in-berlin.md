With all due respect to Pres. Kennedy, I stole his memorable phrase because I&#8217;m going to Berlin! [RailsConf Europe 2008][1] accepted my talk &#8220;How NOT to Build a Service&#8221;. I&#8217;m very excited to be traveling to Europe; it&#8217;s been three years since I was in Amsterdam and I can&#8217;t wait to visit the area again. In summary, here&#8217;s my speaking schedule for the next three months:

*   OSCON &#8211; Portland, OR July 25-29
*   RailsConf Europe &#8211; Berlin, Germany Sep 2-4
*   LoneStar Ruby Conf &#8211; Austin, TX Sep 4-6

I&#8217;ll be talking on the last day of LSRC to give myself time to travel back to the US.
