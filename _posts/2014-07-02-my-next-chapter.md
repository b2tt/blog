After 2.5 years I&#8217;ve decided to move on from The Clymb. I&#8217;m incredibly proud of our accomplishments during my time there: the site has dramatically increased in stability and scalability, the GitHub development workflow really improved code quality and we increased the size of the development team from 3 to 15. On the technical side, we moved from manually-configured cloud-based servers to Chef-managed dedicated servers, switched email providers twice, moved warehouses and rewrote our inventory and fulfillment process, integrated our logistics and fulfillment processes with an ERP system, and much more. I&#8217;m really proud to have helped grow the business while they helped me grow in management skill.

**What am I doing next?**

As Sidekiq Pro sales have taken off, I&#8217;ve felt more and more like I need to take a chance and dedicate myself full-time to building and supporting my OSS products. Four months ago I started that process and today I take another big step. Immediately, I&#8217;m focused on supporting Sidekiq users and Sidekiq Pro customers. I&#8217;ve created a new [Support page][1] which details three new offerings:

*   a free, weekly **Happy Hour** video chat for people to stop by and ask questions directly to me;
*   a **Tuneup** audit package, to ensure apps are using Sidekiq as effectively as possible and minimizing their operational costs;
*   and **Custom Support**, for anyone that wants my help with Sidekiq that doesn&#8217;t fall into the first two buckets.

**But WAIT, there&#8217;s more!**

To make this all extremely legal and official, I&#8217;m starting a company and **developing a new product**. The plan is to build an MVP for the next 3 months with a similar OSS/commercial hybrid business model as with Sidekiq and Sidekiq Pro. Here&#8217;s the shocker: it&#8217;s not written in Ruby. Stay tuned, I will announce specifics in good time.

Lastly I&#8217;m hoping to have more free time to network and socialize. Are you in Portland, want to meet and talk over lunch or coffee? I&#8217;d love to hear what you are doing, email me (mperham AT gmail com) and we&#8217;ll set up something.
