I&#8217;m going to be speaking at a few groups/conferences over the next two months:

*   San Franscisco Ruby Meetup, Oct 16th
*   Austin on Rails, Austin TX, Oct 28th
*   RubyConf 2008, Orlando FL, Nov 6-8th
*   Raleigh.rb, Raleigh NC, Nov 18th

I&#8217;ll be giving my new &#8220;Patterns in Distributed Computing&#8221; talk, discussing some of the hard problems in the distributed computing space and my own attempts over the last year to solve some of them.
