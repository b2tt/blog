[The Britney Spears Problem][1] is a fantastic article from American Scientist about real-time processing of streaming data to determine trends. I love discovering clever new algorithms and the &#8220;majority algorithm&#8221; is simple, easy to implement but something you probably wouldn&#8217;t think up yourself if solving the same problem. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how Twitter&#8217;s trending feature is implemented, this is probably a good place to start.
