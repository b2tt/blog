I&#8217;m trying to test my pet project in IE by using VMWare Fusion with an WinXP virtual machine.  The problem is one of networking.  How do I get the XP guest to see the server on the OSX host?  I&#8217;ve got my site running at http://localhost:3000 but that address obviously doesn&#8217;t work.  Neither the host&#8217;s hostname nor IP address works either.  How do I set up the guest networking so the guest can see the host&#8217;s services?
