Looks like my talk &#8220;How NOT to Build a Service&#8221; has been accepted by the LSRC organizers. I really enjoyed the conference last year and it&#8217;s an honor to be chosen as one of the speakers this year.

The great thing about the LSRC is proximity: it&#8217;s two miles from my house. If anyone needs a sofa to crash on &#8211; let me know!
