I&#8217;ve been enjoying my holiday break (perhaps a bit too much since I&#8217;ve produced no new blog content) but to shake off the cobwebs I&#8217;ve signed up to speak at [Austin on Rails][1] this month on &#8220;Scalable Ruby Processing with EventMachine&#8221;. I&#8217;ll discuss the advantages of event-driven programming in general, why it&#8217;s especially useful to the Ruby world and some of the work I&#8217;ve been doing in my spare time on my [Evented][2] project. Hope to see you there!
