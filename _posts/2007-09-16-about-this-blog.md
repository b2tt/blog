I recently bought mikeperham.com and decided to turn it into my professional space. There&#8217;s no better cheerleader for yourself than you, right? :-)

I&#8217;ve installed WordPress 2.2, the SEO plugin and Google AdSense manager plugin so that I can blog AND make it easy for Google to categorize my postings with a little bit of metadata. The SEO plugin allows you to add keywords to each blog posting and the AdSense manager allows you to easily add Google ads to your page templates. I hate ads as much as the next person but I do believe that text ads are far less obnoxious and that targeted ads can sometimes even be helpful! WordPress 2.3 is supposed to have some of this SEO functionality built into it but it couldn&#8217;t have been much easier to install the plugin.
