It seems that the &#8220;fast&#8221; debugger does not work for me with Netbeans 6.0b2. Switching to the slow debugger made things work as expected. Note that it&#8217;s really easy to make something fast if you don&#8217;t need it to function correctly. :-)

UPDATE: Martin from Sun commented with some guidance on how to get more information from Netbeans.Â  I could not reproduce it this morning but if you see this behavior, follow Martin&#8217;s directions in his comment so they can get the issue fixed!
