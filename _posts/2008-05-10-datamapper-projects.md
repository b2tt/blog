As someone who was pretty closely involved in an OSS project that exploded into hundreds of little subprojects, I have to say I&#8217;m discouraged to see DataMapper and Merb starting to go down that same road.

This looks like the Apache Maven project and, believe me, that way leads to madness. There&#8217;s a lot of be said for a single, integrated project.
