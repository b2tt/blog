I announced [Sidekiq Pro][1] seven months ago and since then I&#8217;ve released 15 versions with both minor bugfixes and major new features.

Today I decided to pull the trigger and call it 1.0! I&#8217;ve moved the [Sidekiq Pro changelog][2] to the sidekiq repo for better visibility for all Sidekiq users. [Watsi][3], [Litmus][4], [Customer.io][5] and [Travis-CI][6] are just a few of the companies that have upgraded to Pro.

**To celebrate the 1.0 release, I&#8217;m giving away one free license to an existing Sidekiq user!** All you have to do is tweet an image of your current dashboard &#8220;Processed&#8221; count and say you want Sidekiq Pro. Here&#8217;s The Clymb&#8217;s dashboard:

Example: &#8220;.@AcmeCorp wants Sidekiq Pro! http://example.org/dashboard.png&#8221;

A few days from now, I&#8217;ll collect all the tweets and draw one at random from a hat. Good luck!
