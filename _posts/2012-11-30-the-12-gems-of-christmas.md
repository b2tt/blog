For the holiday season this year, I thought it would be nice to look around the Rubygems ecosystem and see if I could find some new highlights or old, under-appreciated gems to highlight in a series of blog posts I&#8217;m calling **The 12 Gems of Christmas**. There will be no Lords a-leapin&#8217; or Partridges in any Pear Trees but there will be lots of useful Ruby code for you to explore.

I&#8217;ll be posting one gem per day for the next 12 days, starting with #12 tomorrow and counting down to #1. Tomorrow we&#8217;ll learn about a useful gem for storing trees&#8230; in your database! [Follow me on Twitter][1] or subscribe to this blog to get each day&#8217;s post!
