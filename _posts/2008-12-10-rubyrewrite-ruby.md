Here&#8217;s an interesting talk from Reginald Braithwaite on Ruby code manipulation. I&#8217;m wondering if the difficulties he&#8217;s found in trying to build macro processing in Ruby is intrinstic in Ruby&#8217;s design. It seems like macros are a fringe feature in Ruby, but a core feature in Lispy languages due to language design. When code is data and data is code, macros become second nature.
