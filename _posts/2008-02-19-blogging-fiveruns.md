We at FiveRuns are trying to make a more concerted effort to blog regularly on the [FiveRuns blog][1].  To that end, I&#8217;ve written [my first post][2] on the various storage options considered for our metric storage subsystem.  I&#8217;ll probably focus most of my posts over the next few months on my ongoing work to tune and scale our service.  That type of content is what interests me and I hope you enjoy it too.
