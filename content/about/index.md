I'm an independent open source software developer based in Portland, OR where I live with a beautiful wife and energetic little boy.

I've been writing software since 1993 and open source since 1995.

Today I'm the founder and CEO of [Contributed Systems][1], my own company dedicated to building and supporting
open-source-based application infrastructure.
