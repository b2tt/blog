I'm an independent open source software developer based in Portland, OR where I live with a beautiful wife and energetic little boy.

I've been writing software since 1993 and open source since 1995.  I actually don't know of any Win32 open source before my little menu bar, [AppBar][1], was released with full source code.  At the time, all I had to go on was MSDN documentation!

Today I'm the founder and CEO of [Contributed Systems][2], my own company dedicated to building and supporting
open-source-based application infrastructure.
